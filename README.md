To add a new widget:

1. Add the code here in the appropriate section directory, following the pattern of others
2. Add a line to the markdowns (https://github.com/IPCPS/playground-9dxcuq8k/tree/master/markdowns) that includes a reference to run the code you added (copy existing examples)
2. Log into the IPCPS dev account on tech.io (https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1h0OkpZZp09VSOHU-Rd0103OPtzGiTPHyCQBsB3P7mpg/edit)
3. Navigate to the playground and find the widget for the example you just added, copy its embed code, and add it where needed
